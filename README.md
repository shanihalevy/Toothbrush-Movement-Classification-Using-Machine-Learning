# 🦷 Brush-Sense: Sensor-Based Toothbrush Movement Classifier

This project implements a complete Machine Learning pipeline for classifying four toothbrushing movements: Rest, Left-Right, Up-Down, and Circular. The solution integrates signal processing, feature engineering, feature selection, and supervised ML models to transform noisy sensor data into a reliable behavioral classifier.
